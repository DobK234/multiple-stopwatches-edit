## Summary

This tool allows you to create, name, and bind a key to multiple stopwatches. Pressing the keybind will toggle between starting and stopping. You can also create a "macro", which is a single keyboard shortcut that starts and stops multiple stopwatches at once.

I edited eberleant's original version to better fit my use case. The time formatting is now hh:mm:ss, there is a total tracker that adds all of the stopwatch's times, there's a default "Breaks" stopwatch (which does not get counted by the total tracker), and there's a scrollable box which tracks each time a stopwatch is started or stopped.

Many thanks to eberleant for the tool, it's great and I use it a lot.
