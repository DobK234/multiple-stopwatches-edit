## Summary

This tool allows you to create, name, and bind a key to multiple stopwatches. Pressing the keybind will toggle between starting and stopping. You can also create a "macro", which is a single keyboard shortcut that starts and stops multiple stopwatches at once.

I edited the original project by eberleant to fit my use case better. The formatting has now been changed to HH:MM:SS, there's a tracker at the bottom which adds up the times on all of the stopwatches, and there's a default "Breaks" stopwatch (which is excluded from the total timer tracker).

Many thanks to the original creator, this is a great tool that I use a lot.
